A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is a finite State machine that accepts/rejects finite strings of symbols and only produces a unique computation (or run) of the automaton for each input string.

A deterministic finite automaton M is a 5-tuple, (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), consisting of
– a finite set of states (Q)
– a finite set of input symbols called the alphabet (Σ)
– a transition function (δ : Q × Σ → Q)
– a start State (q0 ∈ Q)
– a set of accept states (F ⊆ Q)

Let w = a1a2 … an be a string over the alphabet Σ. The automaton M accepts the string w if a sequence of states, r0,r1, …, rn, exists in Q with the following conditions:
– r0 = q0
– ri+1 = δ(ri, ai+1), for i = 0, …, n−1
– rn ∈ F.
